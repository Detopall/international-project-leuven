			<h1>Kicking It Up a Notch</h1>
			<p>Exploring Leuven's AI and Soccer Scene</p>
			<p>
				Leuven may be a quaint, historic city, but it's also a hub for
				cutting-edge technology and a passionate soccer community. As
				part of our school project, we dove headfirst into the
				intersection of these two worlds, and what we found was nothing
				short of fascinating.

					Monday - 17/4 - A Day at UCLL: Exploring AI and Football
					Statistics
				</h2>
				<p>
					Leuven, a picturesque Belgian city, is not only renowned for
					its architecture and history but also as a technology and
					innovation hub. The University College Leuven-Limburg (UCLL)
					leads this progress with its dynamic courses and diverse
					student body. In this blog, I recount my memorable day at
					UCLL, exploring AI, deep learning, and football statistics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our day began with a captivating lecture on AI and deep
					learning, where the instructor provided clear expectations
					for our end results. The excitement heightened as we delved
					into applying these techniques to real-world problems using
					AI algorithms and databases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Post-lunch, we immersed ourselves in football, gaining
					access to a dataset containing detailed Oud-Heverlee Leuven
					(OHL) football club statistics, covering every action during
					their matches throughout the season. In groups of five, we
					collaborated with UCLL students and international students
					from various backgrounds, enriching the experience through
					shared ideas and learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					The diverse group of learners tackled the task of analyzing
					the data using the AI and deep learning techniques learned
					earlier, while also managing the data with the database.
					This hands-on approach to learning exemplified the
					innovative spirit of UCLL, solidifying its reputation as a
					leader in technology and education.

					Tuesday - 18/4 - Developing Football Talent and Embracing
					Local Culture in OHL's Town
				</h2>
				<p>
					Today, we worked on the project for the OHL football club.
					Our team was tasked with developing a program to help
					identify talented goalkeepers more easily. We spent most of
					the day brainstorming and developing ideas, and we were able
					to come up with a solution that we were all proud of.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later in the evening, we decided to explore the town and
					immerse ourselves in the local culture. We joined other
					international members and headed to the town hall to attend
					a speech. The atmosphere was lively and engaging, and we
					enjoyed the opportunity to meet new people and share our
					experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the speech, we decided to unwind and relax by having
					dinner at the popular restaurant, Balls and Glory. We
					indulged in delicious meatballs and sides, and we were all
					impressed by the restaurant's unique and inventive menu.
				</p>
				<p>
					To cap off the night, we headed to "De Oude Markt" for a few
					drinks. The lively atmosphere and friendly locals made for a
					memorable experience, and we were all glad we had taken the
					opportunity to experience a bit of the local nightlife.

				<h2>
					Wednesday - 19/4 - Collaborative Efforts and Overcoming
					Challenges
				</h2>
				<p>
					On Wednesday, we started the day with a discussion with our
					teachers about the progress of our project. Each group had
					its own meeting, where we shared our ideas and updates on
					our individual tasks. The discussion was insightful, and we
					received valuable feedback on how we could improve our
					output.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the meetings, we spent the rest of the day working on
					our individual tasks. Our primary goal for the day was to
					finish the database queries that filtered all the football
					data and start working on visualisation. We divided
					ourselves into small groups and worked collaboratively to
					ensure that we made significant progress by the end of the
					day.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the day progressed, we encountered some challenges that
					we had to overcome, but we managed to solve them by using
					teamwork and problem-solving skills. By the end of the day,
					we were pleased with the progress we had made, and we had a
					small discussion within each group about the plan for the
					following day.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later in the evening, we decided to explore the old market
					area of the city. We walked around and explored some of the
					cosy cafes and tried some delicious local cuisine. We also
					had some beer, which was the perfect way to relax and unwind
					after a busy day. We didn't stay out too late because we
					wanted to be fresh and ready for the project the next day.

				<h2>
					Thursday - 17/4 - Preparing for Success: A Productive
					Thursday Evening
				</h2>

				<p>
					Thursday evening was a crucial one for our group as we
					needed to finalize our preparation for the presentation
					scheduled on Friday. Despite the pressure, we were
					determined to make the most of our day.
				</p>

				<p>
					As we settled down to work, we realized how far we had come
					with our project. Our group was almost finished with the
					visualization, and we felt confident about the progress we
					had made. We divided our tasks, worked collaboratively, and
					reviewed each other's work.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, after several hours of hard work, we achieved our
					goal for the day. Our preparation for the presentation
					was complete, and we felt confident in the outcome. We were
					ready to showcase our hard work and dedication the following
					day.
				</p>

				<p>
					The IBM organization invited our international group to a well-organized dinner. However, Denis and two other students had to wait until Iftar, which is the time when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan, causing a slight delay. This was on problem as we insisted that we would wait for them. Afterward, we concluded the evening with some drinks, ice cream, and a restful night's sleep.

				<h2>Friday - 18/4 - A Day of Stress, Rehearsals, and Fries</h2>
				<p>
					We've received our daily dose of stress early, by waking up
					around 8h10. It's friday or 'present your project day' and
					thus arriving late was not part of the schedule. When making
					our beds and opening our blinds to let some light in, a
					realisation came to us as a beam of light. Victor, Liam and
					I had to hand in our bed sheets, clean up our mess or else
					we would face a fifty dollar fine. So on top of nearly being
					late, we also had to rush and clean our room.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally done cleaning, luggage packed, ready to go and give
					this presentation. Liam and I had to present at a later
					time, but Victor had to present around 9h10. Victor managed
					to make it in time and Liam and I used that extra time to
					rehearse for our project. While in different groups we still
					had somewhat the same outcome.
				</p>
				<p>
					Preparing to present our project was the hardest part, as I
					was sweating bullets. This might be related to us running to
					catch the bus as if we were being chased by demons, but this
					presentation was also in front of the OHL team. The scope of
					the project, as mentioned before, was providing the OHL
					football club a visual 'app', so that they could use it to
					determine the status of players. My presentation went
					alright, it was not one of the best by far, but I have
					gotten a few compliments from the staff for my visualisation
					of their data.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were a total of twenty one groups and only three
					groups were allowed to present their findings for the entire
					class with OHL staff included. Neither of us Howest students
					managed to get into the top three. To be honest, we tried
					our best to present something decent, but when I tell you
					that our projects didn't even scratch the surface of what
					these top three groups did. Their visualisation was on a
					different level and you couldn't compare it to ours. The OHL
					staff were so impressed with their findings that the best
					group received OHL football t-shirts. The rest received
					scratch off tickets and coupons.
				</p>
				<p>
					By being in Belgium, we obviously had to grab some fries for
					lunch provided by IBM and UCLL. We have made some friends
					and enemies along the way, but overall this trip to Leuven
					was pretty amazing.
