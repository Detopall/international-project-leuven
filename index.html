		<h1>Kicking It Up a Notch</h1>
		<p>Exploring Leuven's AI and Soccer Scene</p>
		<p>
			Leuven may be a quaint, historic city, but it's also a hub for
			cutting-edge technology and a passionate soccer community. As
			part of our school project, we dove headfirst into the
			intersection of these two worlds, and what we found was nothing
			short of fascinating.

			<h2>Wednesday - 19/4</h2>
			<p>
				On Wednesday, we started the day with a discussion with our
				teachers about the progress of our project. Each group had
				its own meeting, where we shared our ideas and updates on
				our individual tasks. The discussion was insightful, and we
				received valuable feedback on how we could improve our
				output.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the meetings, we spent the rest of the day working on
				our individual tasks. Our primary goal for the day was to
				finish the commands that filtered all the football data
				of the database and start working on visualisation. We divided ourselves
				into small groups and worked collaboratively to ensure that
				we made significant progress by the end of the day.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the day progressed, my group encountered some challenges that
				we had to overcome, but we managed to solve them by using
				teamwork and problem-solving skills. By the end of the day,
				we were pleased with the progress we had made, and we had a
				small discussion within the group about the plan for the
				following day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later in the evening, I decided to visit the old market area
				of the city together with the other Howest students. We walked around and explored some of the
				cafes and tried some delicious local cuisine. We also
				had some beer, which was the perfect way to relax and unwind
				after a busy day.
			</p>
			<p>We didn't stay out too late because we wanted to be fresh and ready for the project the next day.</p>

			<h2>Friday - 18/4</h2>
			<p>
				We've received our daily dose of stress early, by waking up
				around 8h10. It's friday or 'present your project day' and
				thus arriving late was not part of the schedule. When making
				our beds and opening our blinds to let some light in, a
				realisation came to us as a beam of light. Victor, Liam and
				I had to hand in our bed sheets, clean up our mess or else
				we would face a fifty dollar fine. So on top of nearly being
				late, we also had to rush and clean our room.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally done cleaning, luggage packed, ready to go and give
				this presentation. Liam and I had to present at a later
				time, but Victor had to present around 9h10. Victor managed
				to make it in time and Liam and I used that extra time to
				rehearse for our project. While in different groups we still
				had somewhat the same outcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				Preparing to present our project was the hardest part, as I
				was sweating bullets. This might be related to us running to
				catch the bus as if we were being chased by demons, but this
				presentation was also in front of the OHL team. The scope of
				the project, as mentioned before, was providing the OHL
				football club a visual 'app', so that they could use it to
				determine the status of players. My presentation went
				alright, it was not one of the best by far, but I have
				gotten a few compliments from the staff for my visualisation
				of their data.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were a total of twenty one groups and only three
				groups were allowed to present their findings for the entire
				class with OHL staff included. Neither of us Howest students
				managed to get into the top three. To be honest, we tried
				our best to present something decent, but when I tell you
				that our projects didn't even scratch the surface of what
				these top three groups did. Their visualisation was on a
				different level and you couldn't compare it to ours. The OHL
				staff were so impressed with their findings that the best
				group received OHL football t-shirts. The rest received
				scratch off tickets and coupons.
			</p>
			<p>
				By being in Belgium, we obviously had to grab some fries for
				lunch provided by IBM and UCLL. We have made some friends
				and enemies along the way, but overall this trip to Leuven
				was pretty amazing.
