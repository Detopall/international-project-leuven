# Leuven International Project Blog

This repo is meant as a school project. We will use the github pages to present our blog of our time in Leuven.

## Usage

``**MAKE SURE TO START FROM YOUR INDIVIDUAL BRANCH**``. This is to make sure we don't have any merge conflicts. (also make sure to pull before beginning and before pushing)

Copy paste your text inside the ``p tags``. Add an ``image`` (or multiple) at the end of your section.

Make sure to add this inside a ``span`` "Written By \<FistName Lastname>" below the image so that the lecturer knows who wrote that section.

The ``h2``s are meant for the title of the blog section (Monday 17/4)

## Changes

If you want to spend time on the layout or change some things around, make sure to inform the other people in the group and update the readme for structural changes. Mind you, this is not a beauty/coding project, but a English writing assignment.
